Rising Civilizations is a modpack that focus on starting your own civilization and progressing through three distinct ages of technology. The quest system in place guides players on how to progress through and to each age of technology.

As a civilization, you are able to claim land using deeds/deed pedestals and you can raid other civilizations' lands by destroying their deed pedestal. Blocks destroyed in explosions regenerate over time. Various small and large dungeons spawn throughout the world for you to conquer. There is no unnecessary or artificial grind in order to ensure that the players have fun (I'm looking at you SevTech: Ages). The difficulty of the modpack also increases when you reach certain milestones. This modpack is best played with friends.

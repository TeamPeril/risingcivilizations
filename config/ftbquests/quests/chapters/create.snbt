Once the reaction is jump started, it will begin consuming supplied Deuterium and Tritium, creating plasma and generating power."

				"The statistics tab details the required ignition temperature for the reaction to begin. To reach this temperature, a Laser Amplifier must be charged with energy from several Lasers feeding into it, and fired into the Laser Focus Matrix.  It must be injected in one big burst to prevent temperature from dissipating, so adding Redstone sensitivity or increasing the minimum energy required by the Amplifier will prevent it from firing prematurely."
				""

If a high enough temperature was achieved, you should immediately see and hear the reactor running. To sustain the reaction, the temperature must not drop below the ignition temperature. Make sure the injection rate is high enough and fuel is constantly being supplied."
